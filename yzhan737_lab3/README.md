## Answers

* (Q1) What do you think the line job.setJarByClass(Filter.class); does?
```
As the driver node, we override the method map and reduce. So, we have to tell the Name Node of Hadoop of which jar file 
will be executed. That jar file should also contain the class of map and reduce.
```
* (Q2) What is the effect of the line job.setNumReduceTasks(0);?
```
If we set the number of reduce tasks to be 0, there will be no reduce tasks handling the resuls of map tasks. So, the pairs
of Key-Value generated by map tasks will be the final results.
```
* (Q3) Where does the main function run? (Driver node, Master node, or a slave node).
```
Driver node.
```
* (Q4) How many lines do you see in the output?
```
27972
```
* (Q5) How many files are produced in the output?
```
Only one.
```
* (Q6) Explain this number based on the input file size and default block size.
```
The file is 2.23MB but the default block size is 64MB. So, there will be only block of the splitting. 
```
* (Q7) How many files are produced in the output?
```
Only one.
```
* (Q8) Explain this number based on the input file size and default block size.
```
The file is 2.23MB but the default block size is 64MB. So, there will be only block of the splitting.
```
* (Q9) How many files are produced in the output directory and how many lines are there in each file?
```
Two files. The first file has 4 lines. The second file has 0 line. 
```
* (Q10) Explain these numbers based on the number of reducers and number of response codes in the input file.
```
Since we set the number of reducers to 2, there are 2 files totally. The first file stores the final result of the input 
file. Since there are 4 kinds of response codes in the input file, there will be 4 lines in the first output file.
```
* (Q11) How many files are produced in the output directory and how many lines are there in each file?
```
Two files. The first file has 5 lines. The second file has 2 line.
```
* (Q12) Explain these numbers based on the number of reducers and number of response codes in the input file.
```
Since we set the number of reducers to 2, there are 2 files totally. There are 7 kinds of response codes. 5 of them are 
in the first output file and 2 of them are in the second output file, which means according to hashing function, 5 of them
are distributed to the first reducer and 2 of them are distributed to the second reducer.
```
* (Q13) How many files are produced in the output directory and how many lines are there in each file?
```
Two files. The first file has 1 lines. The second file has 0 line.
```
* (Q14) Explain these numbers based on the number of reducers and number of response codes in the input file.
```
Since we set the number of reducers to 2, there are 2 files totally. The first file stores the final result of the input 
file. Since only response code 200 is in the input file, so there will be only 1 line in the first output file.
